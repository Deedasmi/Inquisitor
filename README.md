Still in a pre-alpha state, basically just a skeleton at the moment, please ignore for now.

Don't look at it, don't tocuh it, don't use it !

What it intends to be:

A monitoring tool with a minimal footprint, clean interfaces and a modern UI. Meant to be easy to extend, modify and deploy. Fully statically compiled with the exception of SQLite for the server(to be changed in the future).

Add SQLite compilation as part of the build and link with it statically
