Still in a pre-alpha state, basically just a skeleton at the moment, please ignore for now.

Don't look at it, don't tocuh it, don't use it !

What it intends to be:

A monitoring tool with a minimal footprint, clean interfaces and a modern UI. Meant to be easy to extend, modify and deploy. Fully statically compiled with the exception of SQLite for the server(to be changed in the future).
